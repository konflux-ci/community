# Konflux Community Outreach Special Interest Group

## Purpose

Foster a self-sustaining open source community for Konflux composed of its contributors, end users,
evaluators, and adopters. This SIG aims to accomplish this mission as follows:

* Encourage open source best practices within the Konflux project and its sub-projects/dependencies.
* Establish a communication strategy for Konflux knowledge sharing.
* Promote Konflux innovations through public speaking opportunities, blog posts, and other media.
* Identify opportunities for collaboration with other projects, initiatives, and institutions.

## Communication

* Email the [Konflux mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/konflux), optionally adding
  `[sig-community-outreach]` to the subject header.
* Topics for the SIG should be discussed on the primary [community call](../README.md).

## Youtube

The outreach SIG helps maintain the [@konflux-ci youtube
channel](https://youtube.com/@konflux-ci). We give rights to the leaders of
other SIGs to upload recording of their meetings there, and we may expand to
publish other content there in the future.
